# Infinite Road

Based off Sebastian Lague's [Path-Creator](https://github.com/SebLague/Path-Creator) project, this application generates a road mesh from a dynamically generated bezier path. It has properties for horizontal and vertical offsets and the number of points in the path increases as training continues.
